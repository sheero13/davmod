# ### ## üéóÔ∏è Breast Cancer Dataset

# This dataset is great for comparing the features of two distinct groups: malignant and benign tumors.

# * **1. Bar Chart:** To count the number of cases in each diagnosis.
#     * **X-Axis:** `diagnosis` (or `target`)
#     * **Y-Axis:** Count of Records

# * **2. Scatter Plot:** To see if larger tumors (`radius_mean`) also have more irregular surfaces (`texture_mean`).
#     * **X-Axis:** `radius_mean`
#     * **Y-Axis:** `texture_mean`
#     * **Color/Legend:** `diagnosis`

# * **3. Histogram:** To see the distribution of tumor sizes.
#     * **Value:** `radius_mean` (or `area_mean`)

# * **4. Box Plot:** To compare the range of `concavity_mean` for malignant vs. benign tumors.
#     * **Category (X-Axis):** `diagnosis`
#     * **Value (Y-Axis):** `concavity_mean`

# * **5. Heat Map (Correlation):** To see which measurement features are most related to each other.
#     * **Rows & Columns:** All numerical features like `radius_mean`, `texture_mean`, `perimeter_mean`, `area_mean`, etc.
#     * **Color:** Correlation value

# * **6. Pie Chart / Donut Chart:** To show the percentage of malignant vs. benign cases.
#     * **Category/Legend:** `diagnosis`
#     * **Value:** Count of Records

# * **7. Line Chart:** **Not applicable.** This dataset does not have a time-series component.

# * **8. Treemap:** **Not applicable.** This dataset does not have a natural hierarchical structure.

# ### ## üè† California Housing Dataset

# This dataset is perfect for exploring factors that influence house prices.

# * **1. Bar Chart:** To compare the average house value across different locations.
#     * **X-Axis:** `OceanProximity`
#     * **Y-Axis:** Average of `MedHouseVal`

# * **2. Scatter Plot:** To see if higher median income (`MedInc`) corresponds to higher house values (`MedHouseVal`).
#     * **X-Axis:** `MedInc`
#     * **Y-Axis:** `MedHouseVal`

# * **3. Histogram:** To understand the distribution of house ages.
#     * **Value:** `HouseAge`

# * **4. Box Plot:** To compare the distribution of house values for each `OceanProximity` category.
#     * **Category (X-Axis):** `OceanProximity`
#     * **Value (Y-Axis):** `MedHouseVal`

# * **5. Heat Map (Correlation):** To see the relationships between numeric features like income, house age, and number of rooms.
#     * **Rows & Columns:** `MedInc`, `HouseAge`, `AveRooms`, `AveBedrms`, `Population`
#     * **Color:** Correlation value

# * **6. Pie Chart / Donut Chart:** To show the proportion of houses in each `OceanProximity` category.
#     * **Category/Legend:** `OceanProximity`
#     * **Value:** Count of Records

# * **7. Line Chart:** **Not applicable.** This dataset has no time component.

# * **8. Treemap:** To show house values by location. While not a true hierarchy, it can show the total value contribution of each area.
#     * **Category:** `OceanProximity`
#     * **Size:** Sum of `MedHouseVal`

# ### ## ‚ù§Ô∏è UCI Heart Disease Dataset

# This dataset is ideal for finding indicators of heart disease.

# * **1. Bar Chart:** To compare the average cholesterol level for patients with and without heart disease.
#     * **X-Axis:** `target` (0 = No Disease, 1 = Disease)
#     * **Y-Axis:** Average of `chol`

# * **2. Scatter Plot:** To see the relationship between a patient's age and their max heart rate (`thalach`).
#     * **X-Axis:** `age`
#     * **Y-Axis:** `thalach`
#     * **Color/Legend:** `target`

# * **3. Histogram:** To see the age distribution of the patients in the study.
#     * **Value:** `age`

# * **4. Box Plot:** To compare the distribution of max heart rate (`thalach`) for patients with and without heart disease.
#     * **Category (X-Axis):** `target`
#     * **Value (Y-Axis):** `thalach`


# * **5. Heat Map (Correlation):** To see which medical indicators are correlated.
#     * **Rows & Columns:** `age`, `trestbps` (resting blood pressure), `chol`, `thalach`
#     * **Color:** Correlation value

# * **6. Pie Chart / Donut Chart:** To show the percentage of patients with and without heart disease.
#     * **Category/Legend:** `target`
#     * **Value:** Count of Records

# * **7. Line Chart:** **Not applicable.** This dataset is a snapshot and has no time-series data.

# # * **8. Treemap:** **Not applicable.** There is no hierarchical data to display.
